Installation
------------
We are using wine to run CE-QUAL-W2.
The full CE-QUAL-W2 zip file also contains an installer for w2tool, which might also run under wine.  On my machine w2tool was installed to /Users/matthewxi/drive_c/Program Files/W2Tool
A command like wine /Users/matthewxi/drive_c/Program\ Files/W2Tool/W2_Control37.exe  will launch the W2 Control tool which is useful for checking control files
